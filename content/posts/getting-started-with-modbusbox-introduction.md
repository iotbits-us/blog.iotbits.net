ModbusBox is product developed by IoTbits that   allows the integration of industrial  controllers and devices that have   Modbus RTU as its base communication protocol into the IOT world.   ModbusBox is  easy to use thanks to its embedded web  configuration portal accessible via WIFI when set to work as  access point mode (AP) and client mode after its connected  to your local  WIFI network.  ModBusbox  is capable to  read data registers  from Modbus slaves (maximum 4)  and  send data periodically  to cloud or local IOT services using the very popular MQTT protocol.  Data  is serialized    using  Json format, so it's very easy to parse the information on the IOT server. Slaves variables  can be processed and displayed in dashboards  by many open source IOT platforms like Node-red, Influxdb & Grafana,  Ubidots educational and  its pay platform which is very powerfully and easy to use. 
ModbusBox   has been tested and optimized to be connected to  Variable frequency drives, but it also can be setup to be connected to other devices like PLC's, power energy meters and many different industrial products.  
ModbusBox advanced version can be easily customized to add new Slaves and functions,  this feature is very powerful for those wanting to try ModBusbox with other devices  as long as the user has a clear picture of the devices Modbus register addresses.
